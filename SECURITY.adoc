== Supported Versions

The most recent version "release" version to appear on the
https://github.com/cactus/go-camo/releases[releases] page is currently
supported.

== Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open a github Issue stating only that you
have found a security vulnerability or other problem that you would like to
report, and requesting a
https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories[Draft
Security Advisory] be created.

A Draft Security Advisory will then be created, and the user that opened the
Issue will be invited to collaborate on the Draft Advisory.

If the issue is accepted, a comment to that effect will be made in the original
issue. If the Security Advistory leaves draft state, it will eventually be
linked from the original issue.

If the issue is declined, a comment to that effect will be made in the original
issue.
