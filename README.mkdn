## Configuring

    $ cat config.json
    {
        "HmacKey": "Some long string here...",
        "Allowlist": [],
        "Denylist": [
            "^10\\.",
            "^169\\.254",
            "^192\\.168",
            "^172\\.(?:(?:1[6-9])|(?:2[0-9])|(?:3[0-1]))",
            "^(?:.*\\.)?example\\.(?:com|org|net)$"
        ]
    }

*   `HmacKey` is a secret key seed to the HMAC used for signing and
    validation.
*   `Allowlist` is a list of host matches to always allow.
*   `Denylist` is a list of host matches to reject.

If a Allowlist is defined, and a request does not match the host regex,
then the request is denied. Default is all requests pass the Allowlist if
none is specified.

Denylist entries are matched after Allowlist, so they take precedence.
Even if a request would be allowed by a Allowlist, a Denylist match would
deny it.
